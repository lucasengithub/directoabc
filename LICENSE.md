# Open Technical Advantage License (OTAL) 

## 1. Purpose

The Open Technical Advantage License (OTAL) ensures that software remains publicly accessible while providing commercial entities with a delayed usage model to maintain fairness and sustainability for contributors.

## 2. Open Access & Commercial Delay

The source code is public and freely available for personal, academic, and non-commercial use.

Commercial use (defined as any use that generates revenue or is part of a for-profit entity) is restricted to versions of the code that are at least 18 months old.

Contributions made under commercial use are exempt from the 18-month delay and can be used immediately by the contributor.

After 18 months, the project may be included in proprietary (closed-source) projects under the conditions outlined in this license.

## 3. Attribution & Branding Requirements

For commercial use, the name of the project cannot be used publicly (e.g., in product names, marketing, or promotional materials), but a reference to the project must always be visible.

Each open-source project under OTAL must specify its attribution requirements in a file named FAIR_INFO.md.

This file may include requirements such as UI messages, branding elements, popups, or other visible notices that do not affect functionality.

The FAIR_INFO.md restrictions remain enforceable even after 18 months, including in closed-source adaptations.

## 4. Exceptions for Non-Profit Organizations

Non-profit organizations (NGOs) are exempt from the commercial restrictions outlined in Section 2 and may use the code immediately without the 18-month delay.

## 5. Licensing & Code Ownership

The primary author retains the exclusive right to sell commercial licenses that waive the 18-month delay and branding requirements.

No third party may sell or sublicense the code without the explicit consent of the original author.

Contributions made to the project under this license acknowledge that the original author may choose to compensate contributors for their work when selling commercial licenses, but compensation is not guaranteed.

## 6. General Conditions & Compatibility

This license includes provisions ensuring that modifications and derivatives maintain the same core principles and restrictions.

All software distributed under OTAL must retain this license unless a commercial license is purchased from the original author.

The restrictions in FAIR_INFO.md apply indefinitely for commercial use, even if the project is incorporated into a closed-source product after the 18-month period.

It is strongly recommended that commercial users purchase a direct license from the author to ensure compliance and avoid long-term obligations.

## 7. Disclaimer

This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The author(s) and contributors are not liable for any damages arising from the use or distribution of this software.

For commercial licensing inquiries, contact the original author as specified in the project documentation.
