# Introducing Directo, the modern way to screen-share.
So, imagine, youÂ´re in a very important meeting and is your turn to show your work to your team. 

You can do it in two ways. The first one could be by sharing a shitty pdf by mail, slack or something. The second is by connecting your PC to the screen.

So, you are smart and you don' want to transfer a pdf, a Canva link or switch accounts in Figma on a public computer, so you decide to connect your PC to the screen.

Now, you have to deal with inputs, cables and discover that Windows treats that display as a second display and now you need to configure stuff.

So this process is disgusting. It should be a better way to do this.

## And yes, it is and is called Directo.

Directo is easy. It uses the robust WebRTC technology present in videocall apps to share your screen between PCs.

No more hassle, no more bullshit. Just Screen-share, Just Directo.
